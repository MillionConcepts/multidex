It is possible that this should eventually go in the django static folder with a name like dash_assets.
Or maybe not. Dash certainly doesn't _need_ to go through django to access local assets, although it's a little
awkward...it really depends on whether or not the WSGI layer (gunicorn or whatever) gets confused by dash doing so.
